 # 14. Correctly Define Heading Levels of a Web Page

**[📹 Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/screen-reader-correctly-define-heading-levels-of-a-web-page)**


* `<h1>` should be the first heading on the page. If the text has to be bolded or capitalized, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a heading (rather just a `<p>` or `<span>` tag with some additional styling.)

* 👍 Carefully considering the heading structure in advance will make you webpage much easier and clearer to navigate - not just for the users with assistive devices, for everyone. 

* 🤔 To see the structure of the page as interpreted by screen readers and other assistive devices, use [Firefox' accessibility inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector). 

You can enable it by going to the developer tools and clicking **Turn On Accessibility Features button** (under the Accessibility tab).
