* Make sure your images have an alternate (`alt`) text! 👍

* The `alt` attribute allows you to specify a simple string to be used whenever an image is not available, whether the image fails to load or when you're using a screen reader.

* If you don't provide an `alt` attribute, the screen reader will instead read the name of the file (not very helpful!)
