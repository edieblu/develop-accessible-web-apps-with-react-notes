 # 23. Test for Insufficient Color Contrast Accessibility Issues

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/mac-test-for-insufficient-color-contrast-accessibility-issues)**


* Use the [High Contrast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph) browser extension to test the color in different modes. You can also test in the **Accessibility** menu (MacOS) or in Windows high contrast mode.

* Food for thought: There are **roughly 320 million people with some form of color vision deficiency**. This means about 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women suffer from some form of color blindness so it affects men much more substantially than women. This also means that **around 1 out of 20 users of your site will likely have some form of color vision deficiency**.
