* On your MacOS computer go to **System preferences**, then **Accessibility**.

* 👍 For quick access in the future, you can check the **Show Accessibilty status in menu bar**. 

Go to **Display** and play with the different settings there. The three most important ones (for testing your website) are:
- invert color
- use grayscale
- display contrast (slider)

* Make sure that with any combination of these settings, your webpage is still clear and easy to read.
