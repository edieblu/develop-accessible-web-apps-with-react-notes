 # 24. Use Sufficient Color Contrast in Web Page Design

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/chrome-devtools-use-sufficient-color-contrast-in-web-page-design)**


* Contrast ratio is the relationship between the foreground color and the background color in terms of luminance. When the colors are very similar, we have a low contrast ratio. When the colors are very different, we get a high contrast ratio.

**What is a sufficient color contrast ratio?**

To achieve [AA (Minimum) level](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) you'll need:

- Text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- Large text - at least 18 point (typically 24px) or 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold - has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

To achieve [AAA (Enhanced) level](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-enhanced):

- Text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1.
- Large text - at least 18 point (typically 24px) or 14 point (typically 18.66px) bold - has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

* You can see the color contrast ratios right in the developer tools. Alternatively, you can also use other tools such as [Accessible Color Picker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessible-color-picker/bgfhbflmeekopanooidljpnmnljdihld?hl=en-US) Chrome plugin. This tool will evaluate your color contrast ratios and suggest good alternatives if you are currently failing the accessibility standards.
