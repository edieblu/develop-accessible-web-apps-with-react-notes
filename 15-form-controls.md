* If you have `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` installed, you can start diagnosing for potential accessibility issues by running `npm run lint` (make sure you include that script in your `package.json`). Similarly, you can use `react-axe` or `tota11y` plugins.

* Missing form labels is one of the most common accessibility issues.
